## 📖 About This Study

There's a profound truth hidden in plain sight - the enemy's playbook hasn't changed since the Garden of Eden. What was Satan's first move in Genesis? He attacked what God had already declared **complete and good**.

This study reveals:
- **The Enemy's Threefold Attack** - How Satan questioned, denied, and undermined God's word
- **The Parallel at Calvary** - How the same strategy targets Christ's finished work
- **What Scripture Says** - The overwhelming evidence that Christ's work is complete
- **Walking in Victory** - How to recognize and resist the ancient lie
